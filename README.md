# CompushadyUnreal
Compushady for Unreal Engine 5

## Intro

Compushady is the porting to Unreal Engine 5 of the "compushady" Python module aimed at easily executing compute shaders.

This plugin exposes features like runtime shaders loading, conversion and compilation (HLSL and GLSL are supported, but if you are brave you can assemble from SPIRV too), reflection, fast copies (for both Textures and Buffers) and integration with various Unreal Assets (like MediaTextures, Curves, StaticMeshes...).

Currently Windows (D3D12 and Vulkan), Linux and Android (Vulkan) are supported. Mac and iOS (Metal) are currently in development.

Like the python module, the plugin makes heavy use of the DirectXShaderCompiler project (https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) as well as the various Khronos projects for SPIRV management.
