# CompushadyUnreal
Compushady for Unreal Engine 5

## Intro

Compushady is the porting to Unreal Engine 5 of the "compushady" Python module aimed at easily executing compute shaders.

This plugin exposes features like runtime shaders compilations (HLSL and GLSL are supported), reflection, fast copies (for both Textures and Buffers) and integration with various Unreal Assets (like MediaTextures, Curves, StaticMeshes...).

Currently Windows (D3D12 and Vulkan), Linux and Android (Vulkan) are supported. Mac and iOS (Metal) are currently in development.
